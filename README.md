# SafeFileWeb
SafeFile Web is [my SafeFile java project](https://github.com/davidhaw/SafeFile) but completly re-coded and revamped for the web mainly with HTML and Javascript. 

## Design
  The website design is made with materialize and is this [starter template](https://materializecss.com/templates/starter-template/preview.html) but with our own text and javascript. 
  
 #Encryption
  The encryption I just call AlphaNum and is pretty simple. You convert all the text into unicode and then put any mathematical equations onto it such as dividing it and adding suff onto it, etc.
  
 #Encryption Flaws
  If you use only multiplication or division, you can find the key used by getting the original text and the encrypted text and then easily find the key. This flaw is not in (to my knoledge) when you add or subtract from the divison or multiplication.
